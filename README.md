# SmallExercises
This is a collection of small coding exercises i've done for various different reasons.

## Current Solutions
Here is all the exercises in here that have been solved:

### Binary Tree ➡️ Right Sibling Tree
This takes a Binary Tree as input to a function and changes the tree to a Right Sibling Tree.  "A Right Sibling Tree is obtained by making every node in a Binary Tree have its right property point to its right sibling (the node immediately to its right on the same level) instead of its right child."

##### Requirements:
- Once the transformation is complete, some nodes might no longer have a node pointing to them
- Transformation must be done in-place, meaning that the original data structure should me mutated (no new structure should be created)
